# Golf Performance 

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to track and monitor my golf score at General Old Golf Course in Riverside, CA in order to identify areas in my performance that I need to improve to break a score of 100.

## About the Project
Golf is a sport where the goal is to hit the ball into the hole using the least amount of strokes. A full round of golf consists of 18 holes, and the most common par being 72. Par is the number of strokes needed to complete a hole in a golf course. Hitting par would give you a score of 0. Hitting below par would give you a negative score, and hitting above par would give you a positive score. 

I set a goal to break a score of 100, setting the maximum score to 99 in a round of golf. This requires me to shoot 9 bogeys (score that is 1 over par) and 9 double bogeys (score that is 2 over par), or an average of 1.5 over par per hole. This goal was set after researching what a major milestone was for amateur golfers. Therefore, by breaking down the types of strokes, mistakes, and performance per hole, I can discover why my score is high and what I need to practice in order to break 100.

In order to understand the data I am collecting, I built a fully automated dashboard, dynamic pivot table, and dynamic table to update as I input real-time data.

## Analysis Summary
Currently, I am averaging 117.63 strokes per 18 holes. The goal is to break 100, meaning 9 bogeys (score that is 1 over par) and 9 double bogeys (score that is 2 over par) are necessary over the course of 18 holes, or an average of 1.5 over par per hole. However, from the data it shows that I am shooting over 1.5 over par per hole, on average, for all 18 holes. To understand why I am not averaging 1.5 over par per hole, I further analyzed the types of shots affecting my score.

From the data, I am averaging 1.26 chips per hole, 2.24 putts per hole, and incurring 7.13 stroke penalties per round of golf. Comparing these values to the average benchmarks, this adds, on average, a total of 20 strokes to my score.

Improving on these performances should allow me to reach my target score because it will decrease my average total score by 20 strokes, resulting in an average score of 97.63.

Furthermore, data suggests that the 1st, 6th, 10th, and 18th hole is the most difficult for me. More data regarding why these holes are most difficult for me can be gathered to discover more areas to improve upon. Possible data can include distance from the tee box to the hole, club choice, and terrain.
